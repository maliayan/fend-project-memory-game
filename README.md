## Explanation

This is my submission for the third project of Google Front-End Web Development Nanodegree Program @ Udacity.

I used the starter project provided by Udacity instructors. This was a static HTML page with some CSS styles and a JavaScript function for shuffle.

I converted this static starter project to an interactive memory game via JavaScript. Also I added/edited some elements, classes and functions within the HTML and CSS files.
